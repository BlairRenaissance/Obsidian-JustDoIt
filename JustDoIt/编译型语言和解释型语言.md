[Difference between compiled and interpreted languages?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38491212/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-languages)

Neither approach has a clear advantage over the other - if one approach was always better, chances are that we'd start using it everywhere!

_Generally speaking_, compilers offer the following advantages:

1. Because they can see all the code up-front, they can perform a number of analyses and optimizations when generating code that makes the final version of the code executed faster than just interpreting each line individually. 编译器通过全量代码分析，可实施多维度静态优化策略（如死代码消除、循环展开、内联扩展等），生成的目标代码执行效率显著高于逐行解释执行方案。

2. Compilers can often generate low-level code that performs the equivalent of a high-level ideas like "dynamic dispatch" or "inheritance" in terms of memory lookups inside of tables. This means that the resulting programs need to remember less information about the original code, lowering the memory usage of the generated program. 编译器可将高级语言特性（动态派发、继承体系等）转化为基于内存表查询的低级指令序列，降低运行时环境对元信息的依赖，有效减少生成程序的内存占用。

3. Compiled code is generally faster than interpreted code because the instructions executed are usually just for the program itself, rather than the program itself plus the overhead from an interpreter.

_Generally speaking,_ compilers have the following drawbacks:

1. Some language features, such as dynamic typing, are difficult to compile efficiently because the compiler can't predict what's going to happen until the program is actually run. This means that the compiler might not generate very good code. 运行时特性会显著增加编译优化难度，如动态类型等。

2. Compilers generally have a long "start-up" time because of the cost of doing all the analysis that they do. This means that in settings like web browsers where it's important to load code fast, compilers might be slower because they optimize short code that won't be run many times. 冷启动性能瓶颈，深度代码分析带来的编译延迟（通常数百毫秒级）不适用于Web等需要快速加载的场景，同时一些短生命周期的代码编译性价比低。

_Generally speaking_, interpreters have the following advantages:

1. Because they can read the code as written and don't have to do expensive operations to generate or optimize code, they tend to start up faster than compilers. 解释器无需预处理阶段，可直接解析执行源码。

2. Because interpreters can see what the program does as its running, interpreters can use a number of dynamic optimizations that compilers might not be able to see. 在运行期获取信息的能力能够支持热点代码检测、类型特化等自适应优化策略，可突破静态分析的局限性。（运行时能看到程序实际怎么跑，发现某些代码特别常用，比如循环里的计算，就会偷偷给它优化加速。）

_Generally speaking_, interpreters have the following disadvantages:

1. Interpreters typically have higher memory usage than compilers because the interpreter needs to keep more information about the program available at runtime. 运行时需维护符号表、语法树等中间表示，内存消耗通常比编译方案高。

2. Interpreters typically spend some CPU time inside of the code for the interpreter, which can slow down the program being run. 解释器会带来的额外指令开销。

Because interpreters and compilers have complementary strengths and weaknesses, it's becoming increasingly common for language runtimes to combine elements of both. 

Java's JVM is a good example of this - the Java code itself is compiled, and initially it's interpreted. The JVM can then find code that's run many, many times and compile it directly to machine code, meaning that "hot" code gets the benefits of compilation while "cold" code does not. The JVM can also perform a number of dynamic optimizations like inline caching to speed up performance in ways that compilers typically don't.

Many modern JavaScript implementations use similar tricks. Most JavaScript code is short and doesn't do all that much, so they typically start off using an interpreter. However, if it becomes clear that the code is being run repeatedly, many JS engines will compile the code - or at least, compile bits and pieces of it - and optimize it using standard techniques. The net result is that the code is fast at startup (useful for loading web pages quickly) but gets faster the more that it runs.

One last detail is that _languages_ are not compiled or interpreted. Usually, C code is compiled, but there are C interpreters available that make it easier to debug or visualize the code that's being run (they're often used in introductory programming classes - or at least, they used to be.) JavaScript used to be thought of as an interpreted language until some JS engines started compiling it. Some Python implementations are purely interpreters, but you can get Python compilers that generate native code. Now, some languages are _easier_ to compile or interpret than others, but there's nothing stopping you from making a compiler or interpreter for any particular programming language. There's a theoretical result called the [Futamura projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation#Futamura_projections) that shows that anything that can be interpreted can be compiled, for example.
