—— Unity编译期优化

[Unity编译期可视化插件](https://github.com/needle-tools/compilation-visualizer) This tool visualizes the assembly compilation process in Unity3D. It hooks into the Editor-provided events and nicely draws them on a timeline. That's especially helpful when trying to optimize compile times and dependencies between assemblies.
