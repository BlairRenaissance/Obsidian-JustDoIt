## preprocessing phase

When you compile your project, you might expect that the compiler compiles each code file exactly as you’ve written it. This actually isn’t the case.

Instead, prior to compilation, ==each code (.cpp) file goes through a **preprocessing** phase.== In this phase, a program called the **preprocessor** makes various changes to the text of the code file. The preprocessor does not actually modify the original code files in any way -- rather, all changes made by the preprocessor happen either temporarily in-memory or using temporary files.

> [!info]
> Historically, the preprocessor was a separate program from the compiler, but in modern compilers, the preprocessor may be built right into the compiler itself.

预处理器所做的大部分工作都相当无趣。例如，它会删除注释，并确保每个代码文件都以换行符结尾。但是，预处理器确实有一个非常重要的作用：处理指令。

==When the preprocessor has finished processing a code file, the result is called a **translation unit 编译单元**.== This translation unit is what is then compiled by the compiler.

## 预处理指令 Preprocessor directives

When the preprocessor runs, it scans through the code file (from top to bottom), looking for preprocessor directives. **Preprocessor directives** (often just called _directives_) are instructions that start with a _#_ symbol and end with a newline (NOT a semicolon). These directives tell the preprocessor to perform certain text manipulation tasks.

**`#Include`**

当 `#include` 一个文件时，预处理器会用对应名称的文件内容替换 `#include` 指令。然后，被包含的内容会继续被预处理（这可能会导致 `#include` 指令被递归预处理）。

---

**`#define`**

`#define` 指令可用于创建宏。宏的名字应全部大写，单词之间用下划线分隔。

There are two basic types of macros: _object-like macros_, and _function-like macros_.

Object-like macros with substitution text were used (in C) as a way to assign names to literals. 像这样：`#define MY_NAME "Alex"`。但这种方式现在应该尽量避免！！更好的方式可以参考：[[7.2 跨多个文件共享全局常量]]。

> [!Tips]
> `#define` 指令仅在定义它的文件中生效。

function.cpp:
``` C++
#include <iostream>

void doSomething()
{
#ifdef PRINT
    std::cout << "Printing!\n";
#endif
#ifndef PRINT
    std::cout << "Not printing!\n";
#endif
}
```

main.cpp:
``` C++
void doSomething(); // forward declaration for function doSomething()

#define PRINT

int main()
{
    doSomething();

    return 0;
}
```

The above program will print:
```
Not printing!
```
