as soon as we make any member variables private (to hide our data), our class type is no longer an aggregate (because aggregates cannot have private members). And that means we’re no longer able to use aggregate initialization:

```cpp
class Foo // Foo is not an aggregate (has private members)
{
    int m_x {};
    int m_y {};
};

int main()
{
    Foo foo { 6, 7 }; // compile error: can not use aggregate initialization

    return 0;
}
```
