## Compiler

In order to compile a C++ program, we use a C++ compiler. The C++ compiler sequentially goes through each source code (.cpp) file in your program and does two important tasks:

1. First, it checks your code to make sure it follows the rules of the C++ language. If it does not, the compiler will give you an error (and the corresponding line number) to help pinpoint what needs fixing. The compilation process will also be aborted until the error is fixed.

2. Second, it translates your C++ source code into a machine language file called an ***object file***. Object files are typically named _name.o_ or _name.obj_, where _name_ is the same name as the .cpp file it was produced from.

## Linker

After the compiler creates one or more object files, then another program called the ***linker*** kicks in. The job of the linker is three fold:

1. First, to take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable program.

2. Second, in addition to being able to link object files, the linker also is capable of linking library files. A ***library file*** is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs. (etc.  C++ Standard Library STL)

3. Third, the linker makes sure all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly. For example, if you define something in one .cpp file, and then use it in another .cpp file, the linker connects the two together. If the linker is unable to connect a reference to something with its definition, you’ll get a linker error, and the linking process will abort.

Once the linker is finished linking all the object files and libraries (assuming all goes well), you will have an executable file that you can then run!
